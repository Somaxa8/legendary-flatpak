# legendary-flatpak

This is an *unnoficial* version of [legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) built with Flatpak.

I'm doing this just to learn more about Flatpak and obviously to use the sandbox for games. Inspired by [Steam](https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam) and [Bottles](https://github.com/flathub/com.usebottles.bottles).

## Unnoficial status

Please *do not report* bugs or issues with this version of legendary to the main author's repository, unless we've discussed it in the issue tracker and agreed to submit it upstream. This Flatpak package is unnoficial, not supported/backed/approved by derrod in any way, it may (or may not) have issues that are not present in the upstream version.

If/when this project is more mature, I'll contact derrod and check if we can make this an official supported package.

## Contributing

When submitting changes to the Flatpak manifest, please try to be as descriptive as possible, since the plan here is to learn more about Flatpak.

I'm trying to not rely on pre-build binaries, so please have this in mind when adding new code to the Flatpak package.
